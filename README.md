# Introduction

DE-LA-LO-MO is an Arduino-based datalogger. The full name is Delayable Latching Logging Module. The abbreviation features the first syllable of each word in the full name. It is a piece of free-and-open-source equipment for environmental monitoring. The target users are environmental scientists. This repository contains all the files needed for building and using DE-LA-LO-MO.

# More about the project

<p align="justify"> The development of DE-LA-LO-MO kicked off with a research project starting in 2022 and entitled <i>Pioneering environmental sensing technologies in microclimate research: evidence-based study of urban green infrastructures combatting urban heat island and climate change</i>. The developer, <a href = "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7358-7875"> Louis, Lee Shing Him</a>, is the project's budget holder. Dating back to 2018, he had completed a microclimate monitoring project in Hong Kong. Later, his first application for a research funding failed. The failure came with a stinging comment, "excessively huge equipment cost". </p>

True, many researchers would unreservedly agree that monitoring equipment is expensive, and Louis is among them. He bought an Arduino kit and started experimenting, while writing a new project proposal. He has little to none knowledge on electronics and soldering, except the experience of putting together a few guitar stomp boxes. But he knew that breaking the cost barrier and bringing improvements in monitoring equipment can benefit many researchers. Datalogger, which is typically the heart of monitoring stations, became the starting point. And that is the story of DE-LA-LO-MO.
