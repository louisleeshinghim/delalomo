In this folder, all the fabrication files required for DE-LA-LO-MO can be found. 


If users need to modify the circuit, the following steps are recommended: 
1. Import the schematic file in EasyEDA under a new project folder (File > Open > EasyEDA)
2. Save the schematic with a user-defined title (File > Save > Save as New Project)
3. Import the corresponding PCB layout file (File > Open > EasyEDA)
4. Save the layout by choosing the same project title (File > Save > Save to Existing Project)
5. Make any necessary changes to the schematic and update the PCB (Alt + U)
6. Export to Gerber file (Fabrication > PCB Fabrication File > Yes, check DRC > Generate Gerber)
7. Send the freshly exported Gerber file to PCB manufacturer
